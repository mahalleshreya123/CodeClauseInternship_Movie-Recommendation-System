# Movie_recommendation_system

I have created a movie recommendation system using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), it a collaborative filtering algorithm that suggests movies to users based on the preferences and behavior of similar users. KNN is a simple and effective algorithm for recommendation systems, especially when you have a user-item interaction matrix (also known as a user-item rating matrix).

Here's an explanation of the flow of this project:

User-Item Matrix:

Create a user-item matrix where each row corresponds to a user, and each column corresponds to a movie. Populate the matrix with user ratings. If a user hasn't rated a movie, the corresponding cell is empty or contains a placeholder value.

Similarity Calculation:

To find similar users or movies, calculate the similarity between them using a distance metric like Euclidean distance or cosine similarity.
For user-based KNN, calculate the similarity between users based on their movie ratings. For movie-based KNN, calculate the similarity between movies based on how users have rated them.
The more similar two users (or movies) are, the closer their similarity score is to 1.

K-Nearest Neighbors:

Choose a value for K, which represents the number of neighbors to consider when making recommendations. A typical choice is between 5 and 20.
For a given user (or movie), identify the K nearest neighbors based on similarity scores. These are the users (or movies) with the highest similarity scores.

Recommendation Generation:

For user-based KNN:
Select the K nearest users to the target user.
Aggregate the ratings of these similar users for movies the target user hasn't seen or rated.
Recommend the top-rated movies that the target user hasn't seen yet.

For movie-based KNN:
Select the K most similar movies to a target movie.
Recommend the top-rated movies among these similar movies that the user hasn't seen.

Filtering and Ranking:

Apply additional filters to the recommendations if needed. For example, you can filter out movies that the user has already rated or movies that don't match certain criteria (e.g., genre preferences).
Rank the recommended movies based on predicted ratings or other relevant factors.

Evaluation:

Assess the performance of the recommendation system using evaluation metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Square Error (RMSE), or Precision-Recall metrics.
Fine-tune the algorithm and parameters to improve recommendation accuracy.

Deployment:

Integrate the recommendation system into your movie platform or website, allowing users to receive personalized movie recommendations based on their preferences and behavior.


It's important to note that k-NN recommendation systems have some limitations, such as scalability issues with large datasets and the "cold start" problem for new users or movies. Hybrid approaches that combine k-NN with other recommendation techniques, like matrix factorization or content-based filtering, can mitigate these issues and provide more accurate recommendations.
